# ⚡ Energy Consumption Forecasting using Hybrid Transformer Model

A Machine Learning project that predicts future **energy consumption** based on environmental and temporal features such as **temperature**, **hour of day**, and **day of week**.  
This project integrates a **Hybrid Transformer Model** built using **PyTorch**, with an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** for real-time forecasting visualization.
